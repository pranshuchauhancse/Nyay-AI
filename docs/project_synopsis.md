# NyayAI – Project Synopsis

NyayAI is an AI-powered LegalTech platform designed to help users understand legal issues in the context of Indian law. The platform provides structured legal information by mapping user queries to relevant statutes, sections, and case references, while clearly stating that it does not replace professional legal advice.

The system focuses on accessibility, clarity, and ethical AI usage. It is intended to reduce the initial barrier to legal understanding for individuals, startups, and small businesses by offering fast, plain-language explanations of legal concepts.

NyayAI supports core Indian laws such as the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), Contract Act, and Transfer of Property Act (TPA). The platform follows a freemium model and is built with scalability in mind.

This project is developed as a hackathon MVP with a production-ready architecture.
